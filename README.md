# About the Kronodroid Dataset

Android malware dataset designed to study and explore concept drift and cross-device detection issues. Created and maintained by Dr. Alejandro Guerra Manzanares during his Ph.D. studies. 

Features:

- Labeled (i.e., benign/malware samples)
- 289 dynamic features (i.e., system calls)
- 200 static features (i.e., permissions, intent filters, metadata)
- 4 distinct timestamps per data sample
- Covering most years of Android history - 2008-2020


Emulator data set is ready to download in CSV format (zip files under emulator folder). 
  - 28,745 malicious samples (209 malware families).
  - 35,256 benign samples.

Real Device data set is ready to download in CSV format (zip files under real device folder).  
  - 41,382 malware samples (240 malware families)
  - 36,755 benign apps.

## The raw data set is available (log files, extracted metadata and APKs)

Log files and raw data are available from my personal website: https://alegm.com. 
However, given the sensitive nature of the data (malware) the access is controlled and only granted to researchers and for research purposes. If you want access, please email me at alejandro.guerra@nyu.edu or mail@alegm.com to receive personalized credentials for accessing the whole data set files. 

Please remember to cite the original dataset paper when using any data related to KronoDroid (see citation below). Thank you so much!

If you have any issues or requests that I can be of any help with, do not hesitate to email me.

## Updates to the data set

I am working on improving the data set, adding more recent files, more data and API calls information. If you are interested, contact me!

I can share original log files of the system calls and other extracted information with the APK. I can also share part of the APK files if you need them. 

Do not hesitate to contact me if you want access to the raw files of the dataset (large size): alejandro.guerra@nyu.edu or mail@alegm.com
