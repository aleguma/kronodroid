# Kronodroid Dataset
Android Malware Dataset. 

Features:

- Labeled (i.e., benign/malware samples)
- 289 dynamic features (i.e., system calls)
- 200 static features (i.e., permissions, intent filters, metadata)
- 4 distinct timestamps per data sample
- Covering most years of Android history - 2008-2020


Emulator data set is ready to download in CSV format (zip files under emulator folder). 
  - 28,745 malicious samples (209 malware families).
  - 35,256 benign samples.

Real Device data set is ready to download in CSV format (zip files under real device folder).  
  - 41,382 malware samples (240 malware families)
  - 36,755 benign apps.

Log files and raw data to be uploaded soon. 

The APK files cannot be shared due to restrictions from the original sources. However, the list hashes of all the data set samples can be extracted from each specific data set (i.e., "sha256" column in each CSV file). Then, the selected files can be gathered using the hash values from the original sources.

If you have any issues or requests that I can be of any help with, please email alejandro.guerra@taltech.ee
