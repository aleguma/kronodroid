# About the Kronodroid Dataset

Android malware dataset designed to study and explore concept drift and cross-device detection issues. Created and maintained by Dr. Alejandro Guerra Manzanares during his Ph.D. studies. 

Features:

- Labeled (i.e., benign/malware samples)
- 289 dynamic features (i.e., system calls)
- 200 static features (i.e., permissions, intent filters, metadata)
- 4 distinct timestamps per data sample
- Covering most years of Android history - 2008-2020


Emulator data set is ready to download in CSV format (zip files under emulator folder). 
  - 28,745 malicious samples (209 malware families).
  - 35,256 benign samples.

Real Device data set is ready to download in CSV format (zip files under real device folder).  
  - 41,382 malware samples (240 malware families)
  - 36,755 benign apps.

## Th raw data set is available under request (log files, extracted metadata and APKs)

Log files and raw data are available, not via direct download yet. For now I will share them with you if you request it: alejandro.guerra@nyu.edu

Some of the APK files cannot be shared due to restrictions from the original sources. However, the list hashes of all the data set samples can be extracted from each specific data set (i.e., "sha256" column in each CSV file). 

If you have any issues or requests that I can be of any help with, email me.

## Important Information

The data set is released publicly and with no other restriction than when using the dataset please cite the KronoDroid paper:

## Have you used the data set in your work?

If you have used KronoDroid in your work, send us the reference and we will include it in the [PUBLICATIONS LIST](https://github.com/aleguma/kronodroid/blob/b84216a4f3b68487ed8c11acb029024dda6164ad/publist.md).

## Updates to the data set

I am working on improving the data set, adding more recent files, more data and API calls information. If you are interested, contact me!

I can share original log files of the system calls and other extracted information with the APK. I can also share part of the APK files if you need them. 

Do not hesitate to contact me if you need raw files of the dataset (large size): alejandro.guerra@nyu.edu
